Use React best practices:

- Use functional components with hooks, not class components
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use composition over inheritance
- Lift state up when multiple components need it
- Use TypeScript for prop types (if using TypeScript)
- Follow hooks rules (no conditionals, no loops, no nested functions)
